# About
This was my submission for my Front-End development course i took in Haaga-Helia in 2019. It is a portal for a personal trainern and it displays the customers and their trainings. The data is from an API provided by the teacher, which is deployed on Heroku. So displaying the data might take a while.

It uses React, react-router and material-ui.

## Future
I don't intend to continue to work on this project. It was a great experience to work with it back in 2019, but i would prefer make something like this wich i designed all by myself.
